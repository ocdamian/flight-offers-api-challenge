# Getting Started

Add .env File to the Project Root

To manage sensitive configurations and prevent exposing credentials in your code, it's recommended to use a .env file in the root of your project.
Steps to Set Up the .env File
1. Create a file named .env in the root of your project (if it doesn't already exist).
2. Add the following environment variables to the file:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Amadeus API Credentials
AMADEUS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=YOUR_API_SECRET
AMADEUS_BASE_PATH=https://test.api.amadeus.com/
```

Note: Make sure to replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_API_SECRET with your actual Amadeus API credentials.
